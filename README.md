# Divi-Filterable-Portfolio-Module-grid-3-columns
made a css change in the divi filterable portfolio module to 3 sections which by default are 4 sections

Before putting Cuscom CSS code on Page Settings
Make changes to Module settings > Advanced > CSS ID & CSS Classes > CSS Class. 

Put this code: "three-column-grid"

After that just put the CSS code below on Page Settings > Advances > Custom CSS


Here I found a problem that is I can't make changes to the "Filter criteria text" section I want the filter to be dark and eliminate rounded
